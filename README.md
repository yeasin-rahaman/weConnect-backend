Features that we have in this project

Itâ€™s an offline services website



This website has made with react, node, express, MongoDB, bootstrap, js, and some other libraries of React.
A user can register on this website as a provider and also as a client. He can book any services and hire them by their email.
On the homepage, you will see there is a navbar, banner, some short services, about us, and a footer.
Then on the services page, we have some categories that we provide. On this page, we have some providers who give services in that category. If you click on see providers and you will see all the providers who provide the service. Then if you click on the profile you can see the details of a provider.
We have a contact page and, an about page.
We have a Providers page where all the providers are available to be hired. You can see their profile by clicking on the profile button.
Then we have a dashboard page from where we can manage all the users and services that we have on the website.
We have implemented an authentication system with firebase and private route means if somebody is not logged in then he cannot see the providers and some other facilities.
